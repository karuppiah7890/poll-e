Questions
- What's a `Simple Poll` Slack app? How's it different from `Polly` Slack app?

---

Exploration
- Simple Poll App - https://simplepoll.rocks
    - Typing `/poll` opens up a dialogue box to create a poll, survey or brainstorm, which are all poll types, shown in a drop down. By default a poll creation form is shown with heading as `Create Poll`, when poll type drop down is used and a type is selected, accordingly the form content changes and the heading also changes to `Create Survey` or `Create Brainstorm`

    - When leaving the dialogue box with `Cancel` it asks `Are you sure you want to leave? It looks like youâ€™re still working on this. You may lose the info you've entered so far if you leave now.` with options to `Keep Editing` vs `Leave`

    - Looks like the poll is created using `Simple Poll` and that app needs to be invited to private channels in case of private channels
